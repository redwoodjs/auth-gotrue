Redwood GoTrue Auth Integration
===============================

GoTrue used to be an officially supported auth provider in RedwoodJS. But, starting in v4, we decided that we needed to cut back on the number of auth providers we maintain support for. Based on usage statistics, we decided to stop maintaining the GoTrue auth integration.

This was the PR that removed support for GoTrue and a few more: https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/7138. That means this was the last commit that had support for GoTrue: https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/commit/3d057db199487ea0b17240317d66ddde3f83f332.

If you want to use GoTrue as your auth provider, we recommend that you first check to see if anyone has forked this repo (by using the [Network Graph](https://github.com/redwoodjs/auth-gotrue/network)) and has an active fork. If not, you can fork this repo and publish the packages to NPM. That way, you and the rest of the community can keep using GoTrue auth. You can also get the community's help keeping the GoTrue auth integration maintained.
